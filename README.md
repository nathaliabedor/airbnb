# Boston Airbnb Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of the Boston Airbnb dataset, aimed at uncovering key insights about booking patterns, pricing trends, and factors that influence guest ratings.

## Motivation

Boston is a popular destination with a diverse range of Airbnb listings. Understanding the dynamics of this market can help travelers make informed decisions, hosts optimize their listings, and provide a valuable case study for data science enthusiasts. This project analyzes when the busiest times are, how prices and property types vary by neighborhood, and which factors impact rating scores.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used to perform the analysis and create visualizations:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For basic plotting and visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- `plotly`: For interactive plots.
- `geopandas`: For geographical data analysis.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning and predictive modeling.
- `jupyter`: To create and share the analysis in notebook form.

## Repository Structure

The repository includes the following files:

- **Airbnb_Boston_Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data exploration, cleaning, and visualizations.
- **data/**: A folder containing the raw and cleaned datasets used for the analysis.
- **images/**: A folder containing images generated from the analysis, such as plots and charts.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and key findings.

## Summary of Results

The analysis provided insights into three main questions:

1. **Busiest Time**: The summer months, particularly June to August, were identified as the busiest time for Airbnb bookings in Boston.
2. **Price and Property Concentration**: Higher concentrations of luxury properties were found in neighborhoods like Back Bay and Beacon Hill, with higher average prices. Budget-friendly options are more common in Allston and Roxbury.
3. **Factors Influencing Ratings**: Cleanliness, accuracy of the listing, and communication with the host were found to be the most significant factors affecting guest ratings.

These findings can guide both travelers and hosts in making informed decisions.
